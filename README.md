# 🌊 Microplastic Pollution Prediction

A machine learning project aimed at predicting microplastic concentration levels in aquatic environments using environmental and anthropogenic factors.

## 📌 Project Overview
Microplastic pollution poses a serious threat to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. This project uses machine learning techniques to model and predict the concentration of microplastics in water bodies based on key environmental data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict microplastic concentration using environmental and human-related features.
- Identify key contributing factors such as population density and industrial activity.
- Visualize and interpret the spatial patterns of pollution.
- Provide data-driven insights to support environmental monitoring and policy decisions.

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of ~5,000 records and includes:
- **Features:**  
  - Latitude, Longitude  
  - Water Temperature  
  - Salinity  
  - Depth  
  - Population Density (nearby area)  
  - Industrial Activity Index  
- **Target Variable:** Microplastic Concentration

> *Note: The dataset combines real-world research data and simulated values based on scientific trends.*
